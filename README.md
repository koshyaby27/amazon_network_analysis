# amazon_network_analysis

Online shopping has become popular nowadays. There are several reasons why people prefer shopping online than visiting a traditional shop. The online retailers have generated a huge amount of profit along with retaining a business model, converting it into a great business. Here we are planning to analyze a network dataset from Amazon to understand customersâ€™ purchasing patterns/habits. The notable feature of such kind of network is the next product the customer would purchases, also known as the co-purchase.

Through analyzing the co-purchase patterns, we intend to build a knowledge-base to further recommend potential co-purchase items for each item.

Amazon uses recommendation-based marketing to suggest frequently co purchased items.
Customers tend to purchase these recommended items if put on display & especially on discount.
Using network analysis, we can find the pattern of these popular, consistent & valuable item co purchases.
